## ðŸ“– About MoViNet
The **MoViNet** model family has been published in March 2021 by Google research. It tries to solve the recurring problem with video classification models, which is how resource hungry the models are. Figure below shows how **MoViNet** compares in resource usage to other **SOTA** video classification models such as **X3D**.
